  "description": "imgs.ai is a fast, dataset-agnostic, deep visual search engine for digital art history based on neural network embeddings. Its main feature is the concept of \"re-search\": results from a search can immediately form the basis of another search. This allows the intuitive exploration of an image corpus, while results are continuously refined.",
